		I am a recent graduate of Stanford University with interests in Statistics and Computer Science. I currently work for <a href="https://primer.ai/">Primer</a> where I help build data products that let analysts quickly and efficiently understand large corpuses of text. For more about my professional and educational background, visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-lefebure-35263056">LinkedIn page</a>.

		In a past life, I was a competitive middle distance runner. Being active and healthy has been a constant priority throughout my life, and while I still enjoy running, I now split my time among a variety of other activities like hiking, cycling, and skiing. I also like to travel, attempt to converse in foreign languages (currently working on my Mandarin!), and am always planning my next big trip.
