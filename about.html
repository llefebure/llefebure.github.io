		I am a recent graduate of Stanford University with interests in Statistics and Computer Science. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist for <a href="https://primer.ai/">Primer</a>, where I help build data products that let analysts quickly and efficiently understand large corpuses of text.

		I am a former competitive runner, and being active and healthy has always been very important to me. I still enjoy running, but now I split my time among a variety of other activities like hiking, cycling, and skiing. I am also an avid traveller and am always planning my next big trip.
