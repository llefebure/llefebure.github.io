		I am a recent graduate of Stanford University with interests in Statistics and Computer Science. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist for SoundHound, Inc., a company that offers music recognition and voice search technologies.

		This site functions as my personal website and blog. Here you'll find me writing about projects that I work on in my spare time. These mostly involve trying out new R packages and analyzing interesting datasets hosted on Kaggle or elsewhere. Other topics that might show up are probability and algorithms.

		I am a former competitive runner, and being active and healthy has always been very important to me. I still enjoy running, but now I split my time among a variety of other activities like hiking, cycling, rock climbing, and skiing. I also enjoy traveling and am fortunate to have had many incredible experiences in different places around the world. I am always looking forward to visiting new countries and having more adventures.
